# SQFCodeSnippets
Just a quick group of files for quick code snippets, I imagine we'll create some sort of hierarchical system later on

> **Files right now:**

- #### LOCAL EXEC - you can copy these one liners into the LOCAL EXEC window in eden editor to do what it says
- #### Snippets - is a collection of code that'll be useful and repeatable through the project
